Hi,

I'm Sean. I don't know if I should learn to program or not. My major interests are design, music, the social sciences, and playing outdoors, but I'm not sure how to turn those things into a career that will support myself and my eventual family. Thus why I'm considering programming, as it can lead many places and still pays well.
